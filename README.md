Description:
The task involves implementing a simple linear regression model using the housing dataset. This dataset contains various attributes related to housing prices, with the goal of predicting the median house value. The process begins with loading the dataset from a URL and preprocessing the data. Missing values are handled by dropping rows with missing values, and categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.

The dataset is then split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio. A Linear Regression model is created and trained on the training set. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test set.

To evaluate the model's performance, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared scores are calculated. MSE measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values, while R-squared indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.

Finally, the results are visualized through a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices, a boxplot and histogram of residuals (errors), and a histogram of predicted prices.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, implementing a simple linear regression model on the housing dataset demonstrates the basic steps involved in predictive modeling with continuous target variables. The model achieves a certain level of accuracy, as indicated by the MSE and R-squared scores. Visualizing the results through plots helps in understanding the distribution of residuals and predicted prices, providing insights into the model's performance and potential areas for improvement.
